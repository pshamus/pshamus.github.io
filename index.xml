      <description>A few years ago, I started working on a project to automate deployments of various types of servers. Some of the server types (app/web servers) were simple; others, like Active Directory domain controllers and SQL Servers were a bit more complicated. Those involved the use of some sort of secret - safe mode password, service account, etc. Supplying the needed secrets at runtime was not an option, as I wanted a fully automated solution.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in solving problems and making things more efficient. From Legos to Erector sets, my mind always wanted to figure out how things work and how to make them better.
My exposure to IT started by my dad in the early 90&amp;rsquo;s. I was constantly borrowing (to his annoyance) and reading his computer magazine subscriptions (PC Magazine, BYTE Magazine, PC World) to gain insight into this new, exciting world.</description>
