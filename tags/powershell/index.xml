      <description>A few years ago, I started working on a project to automate deployments of various types of servers. Some of the server types (app/web servers) were simple; others, like Active Directory domain controllers and SQL Servers were a bit more complicated. Those involved the use of some sort of secret - safe mode password, service account, etc. Supplying the needed secrets at runtime was not an option, as I wanted a fully automated solution.</description>
